# What is PHR?

The Patient Health Record (PHR) API is responsible for storing patient identities in the Consent2Share domain, and for serving patient health records from health information exchange (HIE) via the Information Exchange Hub (IExHub). Currently, only patient demographics and Consent2Share Medical Record Numbers (MRN) are persisted in PHR domain.

# How to use this image


## Start a PHR instance

Be sure to familiarize yourself with the repository's [README.md](https://github.com/bhits/phr-api) file before starting the instance.

`docker run  --name phr -d bhits/phr:latest <additional program arguments>`

*NOTE: In order for this API to fully function as a microservice in the Consent2Share application, it is required to setup the dependency microservices and support level infrastructure. Please refer to the [Consent2Share Deployment Guide]() for instructions to setup the Consent2Share infrastructure.*


## Configure

This API runs with a [default configuration](https://github.com/bhits/phr-api/blob/master/phr/src/main/resources/application.yml) that is primarily targeted for the development environment.  The Spring profile `docker` is actived by default when building images. [Spring Boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) supports several methods to override the default configuration to configure the API for a certain deployment environment. 

Here is example to override default database password:

`docker run -d bhits/phr:latest --spring.datasource.password=strongpassword`

## Using a custom configuration file

To use custom `application.yml`, mount the file to the docker host and set the environment variable `spring.config.location`.

`docker run -v "/path/on/dockerhost/C2S_PROPS/phr/application.yml:/java/C2S_PROPS/phr/application.yml" -d bhits/phr:tag --spring.config.location="file:/java/C2S_PROPS/phr/"`

## Environment Variables

`docker run --name phr -e JAR_FILE="phr-latest.jar" -v "/path/on/dockerhost/phr-latest.jar:/phr-latest.jar" -d bhits/phr:latest`

### JAVA_OPTS
